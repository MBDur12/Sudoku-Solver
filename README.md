# Sudoku-Solver
A basic sudoku solver for a 9x9 game using a backtracking algorithm.
## What I learned
- Successfully implementing a bactracking algorithm to solve a exhaustive search problem.
- Built a GUI user interface with Pygame.

## How to run
- Download the source code onto youer local machine.
- Install Pygame and then run the `main.py` file.

## Next Steps
- Implement a program to generate new and solvable classic sudoku boards when the game is run.
